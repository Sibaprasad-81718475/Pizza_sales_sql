üçï SQL Pizza Sales Analysis Project üçï
I recently completed an exciting SQL project analyzing pizza sales data to drive better business strategies and improve decision-making. This hands-on project focused on database management and querying, revealing critical insights into sales trends, customer preferences, and operational efficiency in the pizza industry.

Project Highlights and Objectives
1. Database Design:

Created a relational database schema named Pizzahut to organize pizza sales data effectively.
Designed tables including order_details, orders, pizzas, and Pizza_types for comprehensive data management.
2. Data Cleaning and Preparation:

Processed and prepared raw data to ensure accuracy, addressing inconsistencies, missing values, and outliers.
3. Querying and Analysis:

Extracted actionable insights using SQL, such as:
Basic: 
 Retrieve the total number of orders placed.
Calculate the total revenue generated from pizza sales.
Identify the highest-priced pizza.
Identify the most common pizza size ordered.
List the top 5 most ordered pizza types along with their quantities.


Intermediate:
Join the necessary tables to find the total quantity of each pizza category ordered.
Determine the distribution of orders by hour of the day.
Join relevant tables to find the category-wise distribution of pizzas.
Group the orders by date and calculate the average number of pizzas ordered per day.
Determine the top 3 most ordered pizza types based on revenue.

Advanced:
Calculate the percentage contribution of each pizza type to total revenue.
Analyze the cumulative revenue generated over time.
Determine the top 3 most ordered pizza types based on revenue for each pizza category.

4. Performance Optimization:

Implemented indexing and query optimization techniques to enhance database efficiency, enabling quick data retrieval from large datasets.
Technologies Used
SQL: For querying and managing the database.
SQLite: For database implementation and testing.
This project emphasized my ability to design and optimize databases while translating raw data into insights that can guide strategic decision-making. It further showcased my technical expertise in SQL and my capability to contribute to the success of a fast-paced, competitive industry like pizza üçï.
