üçï SQL Pizza Sales Analysis Project üçï
I recently completed an exciting SQL project analyzing pizza sales data to drive better business strategies and improve decision-making. This hands-on project focused on database management and querying, revealing critical insights into sales trends, customer preferences, and operational efficiency in the pizza industry.

Project Highlights and Objectives
1. Database Design:

Created a relational database schema named Pizzahut to organize pizza sales data effectively.
Designed tables including order_details, orders, pizzas, and Pizza_types for comprehensive data management.
2. Data Cleaning and Preparation:

Processed and prepared raw data to ensure accuracy, addressing inconsistencies, missing values, and outliers.
3. Querying and Analysis:

Extracted actionable insights using SQL, such as:
Identifying the top-selling pizzas by quantity and revenue.
Understanding customer preferences based on their order history.
Analyzing sales performance over different timeframes and locations.
4. Performance Optimization:

Implemented indexing and query optimization techniques to enhance database efficiency, enabling quick data retrieval from large datasets.
Technologies Used
SQL: For querying and managing the database.
SQLite: For database implementation and testing.
This project emphasized my ability to design and optimize databases while translating raw data into insights that can guide strategic decision-making. It further showcased my technical expertise in SQL and my capability to contribute to the success of a fast-paced, competitive industry like pizza üçï.
